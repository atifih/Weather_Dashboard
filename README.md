# Weather_Dashboard
Retrieving data from another application's API in order to use it  in my own context. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. I have built a  weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

# Contents
The app is composed of 3 files rendering a single web page. The files associated with  the web page are as follows:

1. index.html 
2. style.css 
3. script.js

 # User Story
 A traveller wants to see the weathe outlook for multiple cities so they can plan their trip accordingly.

# Built With. people.

Microsoft VScode - Code editor.
[Terminal] - command line user interface for the z-shell.Used the program that ships with Mac OS "Catalina".
